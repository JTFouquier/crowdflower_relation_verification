Title: Verify a drug-disease relationship in a sentence

<h3>Overview</h3>

Biomedical literature contains a wealth of information that remains locked in a text based format. In order to be able to effectively search all this knowledge, the information needs to be represented in a structured way. In this task, you will be helping scientists organize biomedical knowledge by determining the structured relationships between drugs and diseases.

<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read a sentence. One <span class="object_text">drug</span> and one <span class="subject_text">disease</span> will be highlighted in the sentence. "Disease" may refer to a broad range of maladies including things like "obesity" and "headaches".</li>
  <li>Determine whether the sentence claims the drug and the disease are related.</li>
  <li>If the drug and disease are related, then select a choice that describes <em>how</em> they are related.</li>
</ol>

Try some example questions by clicking the link above. Explanations are given to help you understand the task.


<h3>What each choice means</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Yes, the sentence specifically describes how these concepts are related.</strong> The sentence clearly states that there is a relationship between the drug and the disease.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "<span class="subject_text">Rasperger's syndrome</span> is a known complication of <span class="object_text">fortorzabine</span> therapy."</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>Yes, the sentence presents a specific idea about how the concepts <u>might</u> be related.</strong> The sentence thinks there <em>might</em> be a link between the drug and the disease, but whether the link actually exists is unknown.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Further studies are necessary to elucidate whether use of <span class="object_text">ertanzol</span> increases the risk of <span class="subject_text">Porzine disease</span>."</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>A specific claim is not made, but I think that a relationship is <u>implied</u> by the sentence.</strong> The sentence does not explicitly state that the drug and disease are related, but we can infer that the relationship exists because it is implied.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Probanmab prevents relapse of <span class="subject_text">renoparcinoma</span> after patients are taken off of <span class="object_text">querbitine</span>." Here the drug "probanmab" is what is actually preventing "renoparcinoma" from reoccuring, but we can infer that "querbitine" is also playing some role because it only works if patients stop taking "querbitine".</li>
    </ul>

  </li>


  <li><strong>The sentence specifically states that these concepts are <u>not</u> related, or that <u>no evidence</u> was found to support the relationship.</strong> The sentence says that there is no relationship between the drug and the disease, or that there is evidence against the relationship, or a lack of evidence supporting the link.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Our data demonstrate that there was no correlation between <span class="object_text">plobatinab</span> use and incidence of <span class="subject_text">Torwer's syndrome</span>."</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>No, although these two concepts show up in the same sentence, nothing about the sentence suggests that they are related.</strong> The drug and disease are not related at all; they just simply show up in the same sentence.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "In this study we looked at the effect of <span class="object_text">4-3-bomanol</span> on asthma in patients who also had cancer, <span class="subject_text">kidney disease</span>, and arthritis." No relationship exists between "4-3-bomanol" and "kidney disease"; the unlucky patients just happened to have multiple diseases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li><strong>[Drug] worsens or can sometimes cause [disease].</strong> The drug can cause the disease to worsen in severity or frequency, or that the drug sometimes causes the disease (e.g., as a side effect) in people, animals, or cells.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Patients recieving <span class="object_text">oxcarbazepine</span> often develop <span class="subject_text">ertineoma</span> as a side effect."</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>[Drug] improves or can be used as part of a treatment for [disease].</strong> The drug causes an improvement of the disease or can be used as part of a treatment for the disease in people, animals, or cells.

    <ul>
      <li>Example: "After giving patients <span class="object_text">quertivib</span>, we saw an immediate decrease in the severity of their <span class="subject_text">muscle spasms</span>."</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>
