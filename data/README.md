### Data

Last updated 2015-04-14 Tong Shu Li

This directory contains all of the data used for the analysis and figure generation for the Bio-Ontologies paper.

The EU-ADR authors very generously sent us their raw annotation data, as well as their published data, for use in our analysis. These data are not hosted here. The published EU-ADR data can be downloaded from the authors of the BeFree (Bio-Entity Finder and RElation Extraction) project [at this link](http://www.ibi.imim.es/befree).


### File Contents

- **work_units_for_cf.tsv**: contains all of the 60 sentences from the published EU-ADR that were presentend to the crowd. These data were used in combination with the formatting files found in the crowdflower directory.
- **job_710587_full_with_untrusted_id.tsv**: contains the results from the CrowdFlower task. These data include untrusted judgements.
- **pub_to_raw_mapping.txt**: a conversion table that uniquely links the published EU-ADR drug-disease relationships to the raw annotations.
