Title: Verify drug-disease relationship found in a sentence


<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Biomedical literature contains a wealth of information that remains locked in a text based format. In order to be able to effectively search all this knowledge, the information needs to be represented in a structured way. In this task you will be helping scientists organize biomedical knowlege by determining the structured relationships between drugs and diseases.</p>


<h3>The Task</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read a sentence. One <span class="object_text">drug</span> and one <span class="subject_text">disease</span> will be highlighted in the sentence. Pay special attention to the two highlighted terms. "Disease" may refer to a broad range of maladies including things like "obesity" and "headaches".</li>
  <li>Determine whether the sentence says that the drug and the disease are associated. There are four types of associations, detailed below.</li>
  <li>If the drug and the disease are associated, then choose an option that specifically describes how they are related. Please choose the most specific answer that faithfully represents the information found in the sentence.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Definitions of the four types of associations</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Definitely associated:</strong> the sentence explicitly states that there is an association between the drug and the disease.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "<span class="object_text">Glutorzamine</span> significantly improved clinical symptoms of <span class="subject_text">xylophyremia</span>."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Speculatively associated:</strong> the sentence indicates the author's opinion that the drug and the disease <strong>might be</strong> associated.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Additional clinical studies should clarify whether consumption of <span class="object_text">fluorbenzine</span> increases the risk of <span class="subject_text">adenocarcinoma</span>."</li>
      <li>The sentence suggests that there is a link between <span class="object_text">fluorbenzine</span> and <span class="subject_text">adenocarcinoma</span>, but it is uncertain, because "additional studies" are needed to "clarify" whether the drug increases the risk for the disease.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Not associated:</strong> the sentence explicitly states that the drug and the disease are <strong>not</strong> associated.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "We found that <span class="object_text">retizon</span> failed to cure <span class="subject_text">Bartain syndrome</span>."</li>
      <li>Here, <span class="object_text">retizon</span> and <span class="subject_text">Bartain syndrome</span> are not associated because the drug did not have a positive effect on treating the disease.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>No claim of association:</strong> the sentence makes no claim about whether the drug and the disease are associated. The two terms merely happen to appear in the same sentence.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "Blood was collected from six women who were taking <span class="object_text">fortaxumab</span>, and five men who had experienced <span class="subject_text">heart attacks</span>."</li>
      <li>There is no claim of association made about <span class="object_text">fortaxumab</span> and <span class="subject_text">heart attacks</span> by the sentence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>Specifying relationships between drugs and diseases</h3>
<p>If the drug and disease are definitely or speculatively associated, then you will also need to determine the precise relationship between the drug and the disease. Please select the most specific answer which is supported by the sentence.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>May cause:</strong> this choice has the format "[<span class="object_text">drug</span>] may cause [<span class="subject_text">disease</span>]". This means that the drug causes the disease as a complication or side effect under certain circumstances. How the drug causes the disease does not need to be known.</li>
  <li><strong>Used in the treatment of:</strong> this choice has the format "[<span class="object_text">drug</span>] is used in the treatment of [<span class="subject_text">disease</span>]". This means that the drug (by itself or with other drugs) is used to treat the disease in cells, animals, or people.</li>
  <li><strong>No extra information is given in the sentence:</strong> this choice means that the sentence states that the drug and disease are associated, but does not say exactly how.</li>
  <li><strong>There is extra information that is not given as a choice here:</strong> this choice means that the sentence contains information about how the drug and disease are related, but the information fits none of the provided choices.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Making your judgement</h3>
<strong>Please base your answers only on what is stated in the provided sentence.</strong>
